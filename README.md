# 🧠 NEUROSLOT | Smart Parking Allocation System

**NEUROSLOT** is a high-performance parking management system designed to optimize spatial allocation using advanced data structures and algorithms. It transforms chaotic parking into a streamlined "Neural Network" of slots.

## 🚀 Core Features

* **Neural Dashboard:** Real-time monitoring of parking occupancy and system health.
* **DSA-Driven Allocation:** Uses optimized algorithms to assign slots based on vehicle size and proximity.
* **Infrastructure Management:** Admin controls for defining zones, slot grids, and spatial maps.
* **Live Queueing:** FIFO (First-In-First-Out) logic for managing incoming vehicle requests.
* **System Rollback:** LIFO (Last-In-First-Out) stack implementation for reversing recent allocations.
